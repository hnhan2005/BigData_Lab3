# Implementation Guide

> **Audience**: LLM Agents (and humans) actually executing tasks in `spec-<feature-slug>-implementation-checklist.md`.
>
> **Scope**: How to execute a checklist that already exists. For how to WRITE the checklist, see Part B of `implementation-checklist-template.md`.
>
> **Related rules**:
> - [Spec Rule](./spec-rule.md) — the process that produced the checklist
> - [Detailed Goal Template](./detailed-goal-template.md) — the "What"
> - [Detail Design Template](./detailed-design-template.md) — the "How"
> - [Implementation Checklist Template](./implementation-checklist-template.md) — the "Tasks"

## 0. TL;DR — The Loop

For every task in the checklist:

```
Analyze → Prepare → Implement → Validate → Log → Mark complete
   ↑                                                    │
   └──────────────── next task ─────────────────────────┘
```

One task at a time. Fully complete before moving on. Update `detailed-design.md` if reality diverges from design.

---

## 1. Before Touching Any Code

### 1.1 Verify the spec is executable

Open the checklist and confirm:
- [ ] Implementation checklist Approval Gate is `Approved`
- [ ] Header links to BOTH `detailed-goal.md` and `detailed-design.md`
- [ ] Sequencing Strategy is stated (Foundation-First / Feature-Slice / Risk-First / Hybrid)
- [ ] Dependency Order is diagrammed
- [ ] LLM Agent — Skill Activation Per Phase table is filled
- [ ] Every phase has `Skill`, `Read first`, `Design reference` annotations
- [ ] Every sub-task carries `_Requirements: [Goal ID]_ — _Design: [Sec X.Y]_`
- [ ] Requirements Coverage Matrix is filled
- [ ] Persistence-bound phases have BOTH logic tests AND real-PostgreSQL tests

If any box above is empty, the checklist is not ready. STOP and either fill the gap or escalate — do not start coding a partially-specified plan.

### 1.2 Environment prep

- Dev server / database / workers are running.
- Test framework works on the current branch (run a known-passing test once to confirm).
- Branch is clean and named for the spec (e.g., `spec-<feature-slug>/<short-topic>`).
- Shell commands go through `rtk` (per workspace rules).

### 1.3 Pick the next task

Rules of order:
1. Respect `Dependency Order`. Don't start a task whose prerequisites are `[ ]` or `[/]`.
2. Within a phase, go top-down unless the checklist marks items as parallel.
3. Only ONE task at a time is `[/]`.

---

## 2. The Per-Task Execution Loop

### Phase 1 — Analyze

Read, then decide.

- [ ] Re-read the task text plus its `_Requirements_` entries in `detailed-goal.md` and `_Design_` entries in `detailed-design.md`.
- [ ] Open every file listed in the phase's `Read first` and read it at the resolution called for (FULL vs. `search functionX`).
- [ ] Activate the phase's `Skill` file(s) — read the SKILL.md section(s) mentioned.
- [ ] Confirm all prerequisite tasks show `[x]`.
- [ ] Note any ambiguity. If the task cannot be implemented from the spec, STOP — clarifying the spec is more valuable than guessing (see Sec 5).

### Phase 2 — Prepare

- [ ] Flip the task status to `[/]` in the checklist.
- [ ] Plan the implementation in 3–6 bullets (files, functions, shape of the change). If the plan exceeds ~4h of work, split the task and log the split in the Execution Log.
- [ ] For persistence-bound tasks: plan the DB-backed tests BEFORE writing production code.

### Phase 3 — Implement

Default style: test first when the task is testable, incremental commits, small diffs.

- [ ] Write the failing test (when the task includes test sub-items).
- [ ] Implement the minimum code to pass.
- [ ] Refactor for clarity — naming, single-purpose functions, no dead code.
- [ ] Follow existing project conventions (Elysia controller pattern, Drizzle schemas, service as abstract class with static methods, workspace scoping). When in doubt, mirror the closest existing module rather than inventing a new pattern.
- [ ] Keep the diff within the task's declared `Files affected`. If you must touch a file not listed, record it in the Execution Log and either update `Files affected` or stop and re-scope.

### Phase 4 — Validate

Before flipping to `[x]`:

- [ ] All new and existing unit tests pass.
- [ ] For persistence-bound work, all real-PostgreSQL-backed tests pass: round-trip, transactions, constraints, workspace isolation.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria for the phase are re-checked.
- [ ] Typecheck / lint / build passes on the changed files.
- [ ] No debug logs, `console.log`, commented-out code, or stray test fixtures left behind.
- [ ] Secrets are referenced by env key, never echoed.

### Phase 5 — Log and commit

- [ ] Append one entry to `Execution Log` in the checklist (date, phase/task, files, summary, decisions, blockers). Use the skeleton's log format.
- [ ] Commit with a message that references the phase/task: `Phase 3.6: add DB-backed round-trip test for Foo`.
- [ ] Flip task status to `[x]`.
- [ ] Update `Files Changed Summary` at the bottom of the checklist if this task introduced or removed files.

## 3. Working Modes

### 3.1 Test-Driven (preferred for logic-heavy tasks)
1. Read the acceptance criterion.
2. Write a failing test naming the behavior.
3. Implement minimal passing code.
4. Refactor.
5. Repeat for edge cases listed in the phase.

### 3.2 Incremental (preferred for wide, shallow changes)
1. Implement the simplest end-to-end path first.
2. Add one concern per commit (validation, errors, edge cases).
3. Validate after each increment.
4. Document non-obvious decisions inline and in the Execution Log.

### 3.3 Spike-then-rewrite (only when the design itself needs probing)
1. Build a throwaway prototype in a scratch branch.
2. Capture findings in the Execution Log AND as updates to `detailed-design.md` Sec 10 (Decision Records).
3. Delete the prototype.
4. Execute the now-clarified task on the real branch.

## 4. Quality Gates

### Before marking `[/]`
- [ ] I can explain in one sentence what this task produces and why.
- [ ] I know which requirement and which design section it implements.
- [ ] I have a test plan (unit + DB if applicable).

### During implementation
- [ ] Naming is descriptive and matches the codebase.
- [ ] Error paths are handled, not swallowed.
- [ ] No `any` / untyped escape hatches unless existing code uses them.
- [ ] Workspace isolation is enforced wherever rows are read or written.

### Before marking `[x]`
- [ ] Tests green (`rtk <test cmd>`).
- [ ] Typecheck / lint / build green on changed files.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria for this task re-read and satisfied.
- [ ] Execution Log entry written.
- [ ] Commit pushed.

## 5. Handling Unknowns and Challenges

### 5.1 Requirements ambiguity
**Signal**: Multiple plausible interpretations of the task.
**Response**:
1. Check `detailed-goal.md` and `detailed-design.md` for resolving context.
2. If still unclear, DO NOT guess. Post the ambiguity in the Execution Log with the options considered, and block the task (`[!]`).
3. For AI-agent execution: surface the question to the user; don't invent behavior.

### 5.2 Technical complexity larger than expected
**Signal**: Estimated 1–4h, already ~4h in with no end in sight.
**Response**:
1. Stop coding. Re-read the design.
2. If the design anticipated this complexity, split the task into sub-tasks and update the checklist before resuming.
3. If the design did not anticipate it, the design is wrong — go to Sec 6 (Design Drift).

### 5.3 Integration issues
**Signal**: New code fights the existing shape of the codebase.
**Response**:
1. Re-read `detailed-design.md` Sec 5 (Components and Interfaces) — most integration pain is a missed interface.
2. Prefer adapters over editing unrelated modules.
3. If you must modify an existing module outside `Files affected`, stop and re-scope the task; do not silently expand the diff.

### 5.4 Performance concerns
**Signal**: Task meets functional AC but misses NFR targets in `detailed-design.md` Sec 9.1.
**Response**:
1. Mark functional AC complete but keep the phase `[/]`.
2. Profile to locate the bottleneck.
3. Either solve it within the phase (if cheap) or log as a Deferred Item with measurement evidence.

### 5.5 Missing dependency
**Signal**: You need a function/module/config that does not yet exist.
**Response**:
1. Check the checklist — is there an earlier task that should have built it?
2. If yes, finish that task first.
3. If no, add the missing task in the correct phase, propagate `Dependency Order`, and explain in the Execution Log.

### 5.6 Failing pre-existing tests
**Signal**: Tests that were green before your change are red now.
**Response**:
1. Read the failure. Is it your regression or an orthogonal flake?
2. If regression — fix it inside the current task; do not disable.
3. If pre-existing flake — log it, do not disable, escalate.

### 5.7 Blocked by environment / external system
**Signal**: Task cannot proceed because of infra, access, or a third-party issue.
**Response**:
1. Mark the task `[!]` with a one-line blocker description in the Execution Log.
2. Move to the next non-dependent task.
3. Do not fake the integration; use real adapters and mark the verification sub-task blocked instead.

## 6. Design Drift — When Reality Diverges from `detailed-design.md`

This is the single most important rule in this guide.

**If, during execution, you realize the design is wrong or incomplete**:

1. STOP the current task.
2. Edit `detailed-design.md`:
   - Update the affected Sec (components, data models, contracts, etc.).
   - Add or revise a Decision Record in Sec 10 explaining Context / Options / Decision / Rationale / Implications.
3. Propagate to `spec-<feature-slug>-implementation-checklist.md`:
   - Adjust phase boundaries, `Files affected`, or task sequence.
   - Update the Requirements Coverage Matrix.
4. Log the drift in the Execution Log with a pointer to the updated Sec.
5. Only then resume implementation.

The three files (goal / design / checklist) MUST stay in sync. A checklist that no longer reflects the design is worse than no checklist at all.

## 7. Progress Tracking

### 7.1 Task status discipline

| Symbol | Meaning | When to set |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `[ ]` | Not started | Initial state |
| `[/]` | In progress | You have started implementing |
| `[x]` | Complete | All AC met, tests green, log written, commit pushed |
| `[!]` | Blocked | External blocker; log the reason |

Exactly one task per author should be `[/]` at any time.

### 7.2 Execution Log — minimum content

One entry per work session. Format (already in the checklist skeleton):

```
YYYY-MM-DD — Phase X, Task X.Y
  - Files: [path/to/file.ts], [path/to/other.ts]
  - Summary: [what was done]
  - Decisions: [any deviation from design — and where detailed-design.md was updated]
  - Blockers: [if any]
```

### 7.3 Communication to the main spec file

- Completed stories get moved to the `Spec Review` section of `spec-<feature-slug>-inprocess.md` (or `complete.md` at spec end).
- Material impediments are surfaced in `During Spec → Impediments`.
- Scope changes are reflected in `During Spec → Adjustments`.

---

## 8. Acceptable Deviations

You MAY deviate from the checklist without escalation when:
- You found a cleaner implementation that satisfies the same acceptance criteria.
- You can reuse an existing helper instead of creating a new one.
- You discovered a smaller diff that achieves the same behavior.

You MUST escalate (pause + update design + log) when:
- The interface contracts in `detailed-design.md` Sec 5 or Sec 7 change.
- The data model in Sec 6 changes.
- A Decision Record in Sec 10 is invalidated.
- A detailed goal becomes unachievable as scoped.
- Workspace isolation, authentication, or authorization boundaries are affected.

---

## 9. End-of-Phase / End-of-Spec Hygiene

### End of a phase
- [ ] All tasks in the phase `[x]`.
- [ ] Phase-level Acceptance Criteria re-verified.
- [ ] `Files Changed Summary` updated for files added by this phase.
- [ ] Any Deferred Items discovered during the phase are in the Deferred Items table.

### End of the spec
- [ ] Every phase `[x]` or explicitly deferred with a note.
- [ ] Requirements Coverage Matrix audited: every goal has an `[x]` task and a green test.
- [ ] `detailed-design.md` matches what actually shipped.
- [ ] Execution Log contains entries for every work session.
- [ ] Rename `spec-<feature-slug>-inprocess.md` → `spec-<feature-slug>-complete.md` and fill Sections 4–6 (During Spec, Review, Retrospective).

---

## 10. Quick Checklists (copy into PR descriptions)

### Per-task PR checklist
- [ ] Task(s) referenced in commit message(s)
- [ ] Tests added/updated (unit + DB where applicable)
- [ ] All tests green
- [ ] Typecheck / lint / build green
- [ ] Execution Log updated
- [ ] `detailed-design.md` updated if behavior diverged from design
- [ ] No secrets, debug logs, or commented-out code

### Per-phase PR checklist
- [ ] All sub-tasks `[x]`
- [ ] Phase Acceptance Criteria met
- [ ] Workspace isolation verified (if persistence-bound)
- [ ] Files Changed Summary updated
- [ ] Deferred Items captured

---

## 11. Anti-Patterns

Do NOT:
- Start a task whose `Skill` / `Read first` haven't been loaded.
- Keep multiple tasks `[/]` at once.
- Mark a task `[x]` with failing or skipped tests.
- Silently edit files outside `Files affected`.
- Disable a pre-existing test to "unblock" a new one.
- Fake a DB-backed test with a mock when the checklist requires real-PostgreSQL verification.
- Let `implementation-checklist.md` and `detailed-design.md` diverge.
- Batch up many tasks into one giant commit at the end of the day.
